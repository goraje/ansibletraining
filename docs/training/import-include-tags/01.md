!!! quote "hosts.yml"
    ```yaml
    centos:
      hosts:
        provisioner:
          ansible_connection: local
        centos1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.22'
    ubuntu:
      hosts:
        ubuntu1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.23'
    ```

!!! quote "tasks.yml"
    ```yaml
    - name: Task2
      debug:
        msg: This is Task2
    - name: Task3
      debug:
        msg: This is Task3
    ```

!!! quote "playbook.yml"
    ```yaml
    - name: Example playbook
      hosts: centos1
      gather_facts: false
      tasks:
        - name: Task1
          debug:
            msg: This is Task1
        - include_tasks: tasks.yml
    ```

!!! tip
    Tasks can be defined in seperate files and imported using the `include_tasks` directive. This is especially useful if we want to include a certain group of tasks conditionally.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
