          include_tasks: tasks_include.yml
          when: include_tasks_condition is not defined
        - name: Import tasks run
          import_tasks: tasks_import.yml
          when: import_tasks_condition is not defined
    ```

!!! tip
    You can use `facts` to regulate the behavior of `include_*` and `import_*` statements.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command ?"
    Since the `import_*` statements are pre-processed the execution should be skipped for `Import 2` and `Import 3`.
