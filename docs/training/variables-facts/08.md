!!! quote "playbook.yml"
    ```yaml
    - name: Example playbook
      hosts: centos1
      gather_facts: false
      vars_prompt:
        - name: first_name
          prompt: "Enter your first name"
          private: false
      tasks:
        - debug:
            msg: "My first name is {{ first_name }}"
    ```

!!! tip
    You can use the `vars_prompt` directive to assign variables in runtime by creating a user prompt. Adding the `private: false` directive to the prompt makes the input visible.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Remove the `private` directive and run the command again. Notice the change in behavior"
