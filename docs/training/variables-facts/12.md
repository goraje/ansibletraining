!!! quote "playbook.yml"

      hosts: provisioner
      tasks:
        - debug:
            msg: "{{ ansible_local.samplefacts1.jsonfacts }}"
        - debug:
            msg: "{{ ansible_local.samplefacts2.inifacts }}"
    ```

!!! tip
    Ansible allows the user to set his custom facts in `JSON` or `INI` formats. The files need to have a `.fact` extension.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command ?"
    The command will fail since we have not pointed the location of the newly created facts to Ansible.

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Using the playbook-scope directive `fact_path` and special built-in variable `{{ playbook_dir }}` point Ansible towards the directory, where the custom facts are stored.
