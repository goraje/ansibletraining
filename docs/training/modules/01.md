# Example 1

!!! quote "hosts.yml"
    ```yaml
    centos:
      hosts:
        provisioner:
          ansible_connection: local
        centos1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.22'
          ansible_port: 2345
    ubuntu:
      hosts:
        ubuntu1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.23'
    ```

!!! tip "Tip"
    The `setup` module is at the core of Ansible. It gathers basic information about the remote hosts. By default it is always run at the beginning of each playbook. Check out the module's [official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/setup_module.html) or run
    ```
    ansible-doc setup
    ```

Execute the following command and look for the Linux distribution name on the remote host
```
ansible centos1 -m setup
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command?"
    We expect the distribution to be set to `CentOS`.

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Filter out the name of network interface on the remote host where the default IPv4 address is located. In order to complete the task

    * install `jq` on your system
    ```
    sudo yum install -y jq
    ```
    * parse the setup module's output to make it a valid `JSON` (you can pipe the result of the Ansible command to `sed '1c {'`)
    * use `jq` to find the corresponding key-pair value in the output (take a look at this [tutorial](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/) to get a basic idea on how `jq` works). The key you are loooking for is under `ansible_facts` -> `ansible_default_ipv4` -> `interface`.
