# Example 1

!!! quote "hosts.yml"
    ```yaml
    centos:
      hosts:
        provisioner:
          ansible_connection: local
        centos1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.22'
          ansible_port: 2345
    ubuntu:
      hosts:
        ubuntu1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.23'
    ```
!!! tip "Tip"
    The `file` module is widely used alongside the `copy` and `template` modules for performing operations on files, symlinks and directories. Check out the module's [official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/file_module.html) or run
    ```
    ansible-doc file
    ```

Execute the following command
```
ansible centos1 -m file -a 'path="/etc/foo.conf" state=touch'
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command?"
    The command should fail (with `Permission denied`) as the `vagrant` user does not have write permissions inside the `/etc` directory.

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Using your knowledge of privilege escalation in Ansible propose a solution that would make the file creation possible.
