      serial: 2
      tasks:
        - name: 1st sleep
          command: sleep 1
        - name: 2nd sleep
          command: sleep 1
        - name: 3rd sleep
          command: sleep 1
        - name: 4th sleep
          command: sleep 1
        - name: 5th sleep
          command: sleep 1
    ```

!!! tip
    Ansible's default execution strategy is `linear`, where each task needs to complete on all remotes before proceeding to the next one. You can batch tasks using the `serial` directive in order to run them on a subset of your remote hosts.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Substitute the `serial: 2` directive from the playbook with `strategy: free` and measure the time performance. The `free` strategy allows all hosts to run towards the end of the playbook as fast as they can.
