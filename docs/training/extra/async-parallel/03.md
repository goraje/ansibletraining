          command: sleep 5
          when: inventory_hostname == 'provisioner'
          async: 10
          poll: 0
        - name: 5th sleep
          command: sleep 5
          when: inventory_hostname == 'centos1'
          async: 10
          poll: 0
    ```

!!! tip
    The user can introduce the `fire & forget` behavior using `async` and `poll` directives.

Execute the following command
```
time ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? question "Do you expect to see improved results compared to Example 1?"
    Yes, because Ansible will exit before the tasks are actually finished running.
