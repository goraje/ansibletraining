          when: inventory_hostname == 'centos1'
        - name: 3rd sleep
          command: sleep 5
          when: inventory_hostname == 'ubuntu1'
        - name: 4th sleep
          command: sleep 5
          when: inventory_hostname ==     'provisioner'
        - name: 5th sleep
          command: sleep 5
          when: inventory_hostname == 'centos1'
    ```


!!! tip
    Ansible's parallelism, by default, is limited to the task level and a predefined number of `forks`.

Execute the following command
```
time ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? question "Do you expect to see improved results compared to Example 1?"
    No, because we will still have to wait for the task to finish on the assigned host during each step.
