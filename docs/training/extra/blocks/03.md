                dest: /etc/test.txt
          rescue:
            - name: Copy to /home/vagrant instead
              copy:
                content: Some content
                dest: /home/vagrant/test.txt
          always:
            - debug:
                msg: Always runs, .. well always!!!
    ```

!!! tip
    Special `blocks`, such as `rescue` and `always` can be used to emulate try/except/finally behavior.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
