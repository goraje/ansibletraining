!!! quote "playbook.yml"
    ```yaml
    - name: Example playbook
      hosts: all
      become: true
      tasks:
        - name: Set SSH message of the day (motd)
          copy:
            content: "Working on: {{ ansible_hostname }}\n"
            dest: /etc/motd
          notify: Set MOTD
      handlers:
        - name: Set MOTD
          debug:
            msg: The MOTD was set
    ```


!!! tip
    By default Ansible matches the facts gathered by the `setup` module with the corresponding hosts. Looping over the hosts and referencing the gathered facts will yield host-specific values.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? question "What is the expected result of the command"
    Each host will have a different MOTD based on its inventory hostname.
