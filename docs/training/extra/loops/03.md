      become: true
      tasks:
        - name: Create multiple users
          user:
            name: "{{ item.key }}"
            comment: "{{ item.value.comment }}"
          with_dict:
            john:
              comment: This is John
            mary:
              comment: This is Mary
    ```


!!! tip
    The `with_dict` loop is particularly useful and frequently used in Ansible Playbooks.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
