# Example 3

!!! quote "hosts.ini"
    ```ini
    [centos]
    provisioner     ansible_connection=local
    centos1         ansible_host=192.168.77.22      ansible_become=true     ansible_become_method=su

    [ubuntu]
    ubuntu1         ansible_host=192.168.77.23      ansible_become=true     ansible_become_method=sudo
    ```

!!! Tip
    You can change the behavior of the `become` directive by editing the default `become_method` (which is `sudo`).

Try to execute the `whoami` command on all hosts.

```
ansible all -m command -a "whoami"
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command ?"
    The command will generate a different output on every host

    * on `provisioner` - we will be identified as the `vagrant` user since we did not explicitly instruct Ansible to act otherwise
    * on `centos1` - we will receive a timeout since we have not provided any credentials for the `su` prompt
    * on `ubuntu1` - we will run the command as the `root` user since we instructed Ansible to use `sudo`, which as we have already established is passwordless

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Fix the problem with `centos1`. Use one of the following methods

    * instruct Ansible to ask for password in runtime using the `--ask-become-pass` (`-K`) flag
    ```
    ansible all -m command -a "whoami" -K
    ```
    * modify the `hosts.ini` file by adding `ansible_become_pass=vagrant` to the line describing `centos1`
