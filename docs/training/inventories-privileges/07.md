# Example 7

!!! quote "hosts.ini"
    ```ini
    [centos]
    provisioner     ansible_connection=local
    centos2         ansible_host=192.168.77.22      ansible_port=2345

    [ubuntu]
    ubuntu1         ansible_host=192.168.77.23

    [linux:children]
    centos
    ubuntu

    [linux:vars]
    ansible_become=true
    ```

!!! Tip
    You can use the `children` notation to incorporate property inheritance in your invetories in order to desribe more complex systems.

Try to execute the `whoami` command on all hosts.

```
ansible all -m command -a "whoami"
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command ?"
    The command will be run as the root user for all hosts since the `centos` and `ubuntu` groups are children of the `linux` group.
