# Example 5

!!! quote "hosts.ini"
    ```ini
    [centos]
    centos1     ansible_connection=local
    centos2     ansible_host=192.168.77.22  ansible_port=2345
    centos[1:2] ansible_become=true

    [ubuntu]
    ubuntu1     ansible_host=192.168.77.23
    ```

!!! Tip
    You can define common variables for a range of remote hosts with the same base name by using the `[start:end]` notation.

Try to execute the `whoami` command on all hosts.

```
ansible all -m command -a "whoami"
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command ?"
    The command will be run as the root user for all hosts that have their names start with `centos`, followed by a number in range from 1 to 2.
