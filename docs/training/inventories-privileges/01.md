# Example 1

!!! quote "hosts.ini"
    ```ini
    [centos]
    provisioner     ansible_connection=local
    centos1         ansible_host=192.168.77.22

    [ubuntu]
    ubuntu1         ansible_host=192.168.77.23
    ```

Execute the `whoami` command on all hosts.

```
ansible all -m command -a whoami
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    The default user used by the SSH client is     the same as your current user on the     provisioner.

Add the `--become` or `-b` flag to the previous command. Notice the differences in the command's outputs.

```
ansible all -m command -a whoami -b
```

The `--become` directive instructs Ansible to take the identity of the superuser on the remote hosts. This feature requires on of the following options

* passwordless `sudo` access is enabled for the remote user
* the name and password of the associated superuser are passed to Ansible
