# Example 4

!!! quote "hosts.ini"
    ```ini
    [centos]
    priovsioner     ansible_connection=local
    centos1         ansible_host=192.168.77.22  ansible_port=2345

    [ubuntu]
    ubuntu1         ansible_host=192.168.77.23
    ```

!!! Tip
    You can desribe your hosts with various parameters (eg. `ansible_port`, which defines the port number on which the SSH server on the remote listens for connections). For a comprehensive list take look at the [official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html).

Try to execute the `whoami` command on all hosts.

```
ansible all -m command -a "whoami"
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command ?"
    The command will fail for `centos1` since by default the SSH server listens on port 22.

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Fix the problem with `centos1` by executing the following steps

    * open a SSH connection to `centos1`
    ```
    ssh vagrant@192.168.77.22
    ```
    * edit the SSH server configuration on the remote
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/sshd/sshd_config
    ```
    * uncomment the line starting with `#Port`, set the port value to 2345 (the resulting line should read `Port 2345`) and save the changes
    * update the SELinux policy on the remote (you will need to install the `policycoreutils-python` package)
    ```
    sudo yum install -y policycoreutils-python
    sudo semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 2345
    ```
    * restart the `sshd` service
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart sshd
    ```
