        }
    }
    ```

!!! Tip
    The `JSON` representation of an inventory can become useful when obtained from an external REST API.

Try to execute the `whoami` command on all hosts.

```
ansible all -m command -a "whoami"
```

??? bug "Bonus round"

    Try to reproduce the `YAML` inventory from the previous example using the `JSON` syntax. Since all keys must have corresponding values in `JSON`, use `null` for keys that were empty.

    For bigger inventories you could automate this process eg. with a simple Python script.

    ```python
    import yaml
    import json

    with open('hosts.yml', 'r') as inv:
        data = yaml.full_load(inv)
        with open('hosts.json', 'w') as out:
            json.dump(data, out, indent=4)
    ```
