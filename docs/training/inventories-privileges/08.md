    ```yaml
    centos:
      hosts:
        provisioner:
          ansible_connection: local
        centos1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.22'
          ansible_port: 2345
    ubuntu:
      hosts:
        ubuntu1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.23'
    linux:
      children:
        centos:
        ubuntu:
      vars:
        ansible_become: true
    ```

!!! Tip
    The `YAML` file format is currently the most popular solution for building Ansible inventories, although the default inventory format is `JSON`.

Try to execute the `whoami` command on all hosts.

```
ansible all -m command -a "whoami"
```

Add `ansible_become: false` to the description of `centos1` (indentation should match `ansible_port` and `ansible_host`) and run the command again.

??? question "What is the expected output of the command ?"
    The command will be run as the root user for all hosts except `centos1`. This example illustrates that `hostvars` take precedence over `groupvars`.
