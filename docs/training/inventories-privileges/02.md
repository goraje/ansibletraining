# Example 2

!!! quote "hosts.ini"
    ```ini
    [centos]
    provisioner     ansible_connection=local
    centos1         ansible_host=192.168.77.22      ansible_user=root

    [ubuntu]
    ubuntu1         ansible_host=192.168.77.23      ansible_become=true
    ```

!!! Tip
    Many variables including the `become` directive and the SSH user name can be specified as `hostvars`, which are simply put a group of variables that describe a single host.

Try to execute the `whoami` command on all hosts.

```
ansible all -m command -a "whoami"
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command ?"
    The command will generate a different output on every host

    * on `provisioner` - we will be identified as the `vagrant` user since we did not explicitly instruct Ansible to act otherwise
    * on `centos1` - we will get an error since our SSH authentication method (public key) is valid only for the `vagrant` user
    * on `ubuntu1` - we will run the command as the `root` user since we instructed Ansible to use the `become` directive

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Fix the problem with `centos1`. Use one of the following methods or come up one with one on your own :fontawesome-regular-laugh-wink:

    * copy the provisioner's SSH public key to the `authorized_keys` of the root user on `centos1` (when prompted for the root password type `vagrant`)
    ```
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@192.168.77.22
    ```
    * modify the `hosts.ini` file by adding `ansible_password=vagrant` to the line describing `centos1`. Before executing the command install the `sshpass` program on the provisioner.
    ```
    sudo yum install -y sshpass
    ```
