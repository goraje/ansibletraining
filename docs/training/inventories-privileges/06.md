# Example 6

!!! quote "hosts.ini"
    ```ini
    [centos]
    provisioner     ansible_connection=local
    centos2         ansible_host=192.168.77.22  ansible_port=2345

    [ubuntu]
    ubuntu1         ansible_host=192.168.77.23

    [centos:vars]
    ansible_become=true
    ```

!!! Tip
    Apart from defining `hostvars`, which describe only a single host, we can incorporate `groupvars` that gather common variables for all remote hosts that belong to the same group.

Try to execute the `whoami` command on all hosts.

```
ansible all -m command -a "whoami"
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command ?"
    The command will be run as the root user for all hosts that belong to the `centos` group.
