!!! quote "playbook.yml"
    ```yaml
    - name: Example playbook
      hosts: all
      become: true
      tasks:
        - name: Install vim on CentOS machines
          yum:
           name: vim
           state: present
          when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
    ```

!!! tip
    Ansible Playbooks support conditional  clauses. The `when` directive stores the  conditions in string or list form.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? question "What is the expected output of the command?"
    The changes will take place on `provisioner` and `centos1`, whereas `ubuntu1` will get skipped since it does not match the conditional clause.
