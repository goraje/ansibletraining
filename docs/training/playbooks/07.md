!!! quote "playbook.yml"
    ```yaml
    - name: Example playbook
      hosts: all
      become: true
      tasks:
        - name: Install vim on Ubuntu machines
          apt:
           name: vim
           state: present
          when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
    ```

!!! tip
    Avoid using the `command` module for package installation, changes in `systemd` and other operations that can be automated using other Ansible modules.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Create an Ansible Playbook that will install the Nginx web server on all machines (except `provisioner`). The package that provides the package is called nginx on both distributions.

    * use the `apt` or `yum` modules to download the package
    * on CentOS host you will need to install the `epel-release` package before installing Nginx
    * on Ubuntu hosts you will have to introduce changes to `ufw` (Ubuntu's firewall) - use the `ufw` module to allow a rule named `Nginx HTTP`
    * use the `systemd` module to start the Nginx webserver on all hosts
    * use `curl` from command line (outside of the playbook) or your web browser to check if the installation process was successfull
