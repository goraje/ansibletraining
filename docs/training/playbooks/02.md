!!! quote "hosts.yml"
    ```yaml
    centos:
      hosts:
        provisioner:
          ansible_connection: local
        centos1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.22'
    ubuntu:
      hosts:
        ubuntu1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.23'
    ```

!!! quote "playbook.yml"
    ```yaml
    - name: Example playbook
      hosts: all
      gather_facts: false
      tasks:
        - name: Example task
          command: whoami
    ```

!!! tip
    The `setup` module can generate large compuational costs when running against multiple remote hosts. In that case we can disable this functionality by adding the `gather_facts: false` directive to our playbook.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
Notice that the `[Gathering Facts]` section is missing from the log.
