!!! quote "hosts.yml"
    ```yaml
    centos:
      hosts:
        provisioner:
          ansible_connection: local
        centos1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.22'
    ubuntu:
      hosts:
        ubuntu1:
          ansible_host: '192.168.77.23'
    ```

!!! quote "playbook.yml"
    ```yaml
    - name: Example playbook
      hosts: all
      tasks:
        - name: Example task
          command: whoami
    ```

!!! tip
    Ansible Playbook's are used to gather multiple consecutive task executions. The tasks can be run synchronously, in parallel, in batches or match conditional clauses.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? question "Which modules will be run during this playbook execution?"
    This playbook execution will launch the `setup` and `command` modules on the remote hosts. The `[Gathering Facts]` section in `ansible-playbook` log corresponds to the execution of the `setup` module.

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Using the `debug` module catch the `ansible_distribution` for each host.
