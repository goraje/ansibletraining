    ```

!!! quote "playbook.yml"
    ```yaml
    - name: Example playbook
      hosts: all
      gather_facts: false
      tasks:
        - name: Example task
          command: whoami
          register: whoami_output
        - debug:
            msg: "Remote user: {{ whoami_output.stdout }}"
    ```

!!! tip
    The `debug` module can be used to output the results of remote commands. The `register` directive creates a new variable in the playbook's scope, which can be accessed by other tasks.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

??? bug "Bonus round"
    Execute the same command while adding the `-b` flag. Notice the difference in the command's output.
