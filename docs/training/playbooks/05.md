      tasks:
        - name: Example task
          command: whoami
          notify: whoami_handler
      handlers:
        - name: whoami_handler
          debug:
            msg: "Whoami was called on {{ inventory_hostname }}"
    ```

!!! tip
    `Handlers` are special tasks, which are always run at the end of a playbook. They are called by the `notify` directive. They are often used to perform post-installation modifications eg. starting of services, editing configuration files.

Execute the following command
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
