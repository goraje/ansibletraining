# Each Ansible playbook starts with a '-',
# which means that Ansible expects the user
# to pass an array of arguments.

# The first section describes how the connection
# to the target remotes should be executed.
# Here, the user can define a wide variety of
# parametrs. Most notably, the: name of the playbook,
# target hosts inventory group, privilege escalation
# and playbook wide variables.
